# how many knots should you make? #

# knots are the computationally-intensive part of this process,
# choose as many as your computer and your patience can handle.

# you should aim for between 100 - 999 knots,
# but numbers closer to 1,000 will overload smaller computers

# with census microdata, you've often already got easy access to a relevant geographic grouping
# however for new york city, most of the groupings are either too big to be useful as knots,
# or too small that they'll overload smaller computers.


# the city of new york contains
nrow( unique( sf1.bo[ , c( 'boroname' , 'neighborhood' ) ] ) )
# subboro areas, which is too small of a number of knots.

# the city also has
nrow( unique( sf1.bo[ , c( 'boroname' , 'tract' ) ] ) )
# census tracts, which will overload most computers

# county subdivision and place codes do not exist within the city limits.
nrow( unique( sf1.bo[ , c( 'boroname' , 'cousub' , 'place' ) ] ) )

# so be creative.  take another look at the summary file #1 documentation
# http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/doc/sf1.pdf#page=18
# oh hayyyy how about zip code tabulation areas?  that could work.
nrow( unique( sf1.bo[ , c( 'boroname' , 'zcta5' ) ] ) )
# nope, too many for a computer with 3gb of ram.

# if you have a powerful computer, you might try tying knots at the census tract-level
# otherwise, the neighborhods defined by the new york city housing and vacancy survey work.

# `sqldf` does not like periods in the data.frame name
# # sf1_bo <- sf1.bo

# within each borough x zcta5,
# calculate the population-weighted mean of the coordinates
# and (for smoothing) the weighted share at each borough-zcta5 centroid
