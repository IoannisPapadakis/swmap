library(survey)

# following the analysis examples in the r code repository --

# -- calculate the persons per room rate at the smallest available geographic area


# note the large cautionary text that the standard errors for this survey are garbage #


# set R to produce conservative standard errors instead of crashing
# http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/exmample-lonely.html
options( survey.lonely.psu = "adjust" )
# this setting matches the MISSUNIT option in SUDAAN

# load the 2011 data files

# create a fake survey design object with just the `hhweight`
# (household weight) variable
occ.d <- svydesign( ~1 , data = occ , weights = ~hhweight )
# this svydesign() call is incorrect because nychvs
# does not release its sampling clusters

# this script is useful as an example of how to map city-wide survey data
# but this actual new york city microdata has incorrect standard errors


# the persons per room variable has two decimals
occ.d <- update( occ.d , pproom = as.numeric( crowd100 ) / 100 )

# calculate the 2011 persons per room rate
svymean( ~ pproom , occ.d )

# # examine which geographies are available # #

# the new york city housing and vacancy survey identifies records
# from subboro (neighborhood) areas within all five boros
svytable( ~ borough + subboro , occ.d )

# simply use both of those geographies in the by= argument
# of the `svyby` command, and re-calculate the poverty rates
smallest.area.statistics <-

		~ borough + subboro , 
		occ.d , 
		svymean

# except these results have been broken into smaller areas.	

# these are the statistics to be mapped
print( smallest.area.statistics )
# the standard errors are a measure of precision,
# their inverse will serve as the mapping weights

# again!  don't forget that
# the new york city housing and vacancy survey's
# standard errors are not computable.
